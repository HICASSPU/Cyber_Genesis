  - Email addresses.  
  - Associated names and positions.  
  - Confidence scores.  
  - Sources where the email was found.

### **2. Email Finder**

- Hunter.io will display verification results, such as:  
  - **Valid**: Deliverable email address.  
  - **Invalid**: Nonexistent or undeliverable address.  
  - **Risky**: May exist but could result in a bounce.

### **4. Bulk Tasks**

## **Practical Use Cases**

### **1. Reconnaissance**  
- Discover email addresses associated with a target organization during a penetration test or OSINT investigation.  
  **Example**: Search for emails linked to `target.com` to identify key personnel for phishing simulation or contact enumeration.

### **2. Email Verification**  
- Verify the validity of email addresses before launching email campaigns to reduce bounce rates.  

### **3. Social Engineering Preparation**  
- Identify specific email patterns (e.g., `firstname.lastname@domain.com`) to create realistic phishing emails.  

### **4. Threat Hunting**  
- Check for leaked or compromised email addresses by comparing Hunter.io results with known breach databases.

## **Automating Hunter.io with API**

Hunter.io provides an API for integrating its functionality into your workflows.

### **Example Python Script**
```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
DOMAIN = "example.com"

url = f"https://api.hunter.io/v2/domain-search?domain={DOMAIN}&api_key={API_KEY}"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    emails = data.get("data", {}).get("emails", [])
    print(f"Email addresses found for {DOMAIN}:")
    for email in emails:
        print(email["value"])
else:
    print(f"Error: Unable to fetch data for {DOMAIN}")
```

### **Automating Bulk Verification**
Use the API to verify email addresses in bulk:  
```bash
curl "https://api.hunter.io/v2/email-verifier?email=john.doe@example.com&api_key=your_api_key_here"
```
