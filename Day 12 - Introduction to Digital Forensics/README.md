## **What is Digital Forensics?**

**Digital Forensics** is the science of collecting, analyzing, and preserving digital evidence in a manner that is admissible in a court of law. It involves investigating cybercrimes, data breaches, and unauthorized access while ensuring the integrity of evidence.

---

### **Key Objectives of Digital Forensics:**
1. **Preservation of Evidence**: Ensure the integrity and authenticity of digital data.  
2. **Reconstruction of Events**: Reconstruct a timeline of activities based on the evidence.  
3. **Attribution**: Identify the perpetrator of the incident.  
4. **Reporting**: Document findings in a clear, accurate, and legally defensible manner.
