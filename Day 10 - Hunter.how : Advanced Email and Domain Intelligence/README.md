## **What is Hunter.how?**

**Hunter.how** is an advanced reconnaissance tool for collecting information about email addresses and domains. It enables cybersecurity professionals and researchers to:  
1. Discover publicly available email addresses associated with a target domain.  
2. Analyze domain infrastructure, including mail servers, DNS records, and SPF/DKIM configurations.  
3. Verify the validity of email addresses for potential use in phishing simulations or social engineering awareness.

## **Key Features of Hunter.how**

1. **Email Address Discovery**  
   - Find email addresses associated with a specific domain.  
   - Extract patterns for email generation (e.g., `firstname.lastname@example.com`).  

2. **Domain Intelligence**  
   - Analyze mail server configurations (MX records, SPF, DKIM, DMARC).  
   - Identify potential vulnerabilities in email infrastructure.  

3. **Email Validation**  
   - Verify whether an email address exists and is deliverable.  

4. **Search Filters**  
   - Refine results based on job titles, departments, or keywords (e.g., `CEO@example.com`).  

5. **Exporting Results**  
   - Download search results for reporting and analysis.

## **How to Use Hunter.how**

1. **Search for Email Addresses by Domain**  
   - Visit [Hunter.how](https://hunter.how/).  
   - Enter your target domain (e.g., `example.com`) in the search bar.  
   - The results will display email addresses, associated names, and sources.

2. **Analyze Domain Infrastructure**  
   - Check MX, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to assess email security.  

3. **Email Verification**  
   - Validate email addresses to check their existence and deliverability.  

4. **Filter Results**  
   - Use filters to search for specific roles or departments (e.g., `admin@example.com` or `HR@example.com`).

## **Practical Use Cases**

### **1. OSINT for Reconnaissance**  
**Purpose**: Gather publicly available email addresses for a target organization.  
**Example**:  
Search for `example.com` to find:  
- `admin@example.com`  
- `john.doe@example.com`  

### **2. Social Engineering Preparation**  
**Purpose**: Identify high-value targets for simulated phishing campaigns.  
**Example**: Filter results to find C-suite executives or IT staff.  

### **3. Domain Email Security Audit**  
**Purpose**: Assess the email infrastructure of a domain for misconfigurations.  
**Example**: Check SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records to identify gaps in email security.  

### **4. Email Validation**  
**Purpose**: Verify if email addresses are valid and active.  
**Action**: Use the email validation feature to check if `ceo@example.com` exists.

## **Automating Hunter.how Searches**

### **Python Script for Email Discovery**
Below is a Python script to automate email address discovery using Hunter.how‚Äôs API:  

```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
domain = input("Enter the target domain: ")

def search_emails(domain):
    url = f"https://hunter.how/api/v1/search?domain={domain}&api_key={API_KEY}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        for result in data['emails']:
            print(f"Email: {result['value']} | Name: {result['first_name']} {result['last_name']}")
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code} - Unable to fetch results.")

search_emails(domain)
```

### **Bash Script for Quick Results**
Use **curl** to fetch emails from a domain:  
```bash
curl -s "https://hunter.how/api/v1/search?domain=example.com&api_key=your_api_key_here" | jq '.emails[] | .value'
```
