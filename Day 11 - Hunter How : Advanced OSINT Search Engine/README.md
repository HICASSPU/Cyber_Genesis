# **Cyber Genesis - Day 11 : Hunter.How - Advanced OSINT Search Engine** üåê

Welcome to **Day 11 of the Cyber Genesis series!** üöÄ  
Today, we‚Äôre exploring **Hunter How**, an advanced OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) search engine. Designed for cybersecurity professionals and OSINT enthusiasts, Hunter How aggregates and organizes public data to uncover valuable insights about domains, IPs, and more. Let‚Äôs dive into this powerful tool! üîç

## **What is Hunter.How?**

**Hunter How** is an OSINT search engine that simplifies the process of collecting and analyzing public data. It enables users to search for critical information about:  
- **Domains**: Ownership, associated subdomains, and server details.  
- **IPs**: Geolocation, service banners, and open ports.  
- **Certificates**: SSL/TLS details and transparency logs.  

Hunter How is an essential tool for reconnaissance, vulnerability assessment, and threat hunting.

## **Key Features of Hunter How**

1. **Domain Information**  
   - Collects ownership details, DNS records, and subdomains associated with a target domain.

2. **IP Analysis**  
   - Provides information on IP geolocation, open ports, and running services.  

3. **SSL/TLS Certificate Insights**  
   - Tracks certificates issued for domains, their validity, and potential misconfigurations.  

4. **Search Customization**  
   - Supports filters and advanced queries for refining search results.  

5. **Historical Data**  
   - Tracks historical changes for domains, IPs, and certificates, useful for monitoring and investigations.

## **How to Use Hunter How**

### **1. Domain Search**  
- Enter the target domain (e.g., `example.com`) to uncover:  
  - Subdomains.  
  - DNS records (A, MX, CNAME, etc.).  
  - Associated IP addresses.

### **2. IP Search**  
- Input an IP address to gather:  
  - Location details.  
  - Open ports and services running on them.  
  - Associated domains or reverse DNS records.

### **3. Certificate Analysis**  
- Discover SSL/TLS certificates issued for a domain.  
- Verify certificate validity and look for expired or misconfigured certificates.

## **Practical Use Cases**

### **1. Reconnaissance**  
**Purpose**: Gather detailed information about a target organization.  
**Action**: Search for `example.com` to uncover subdomains, associated IPs, and DNS records.

### **2. Threat Hunting**  
**Purpose**: Identify exposed assets or misconfigured services.  
**Action**: Search for open ports on a specific IP range.

### **3. Monitoring Domain Security**  
**Purpose**: Detect changes in DNS records, certificates, or newly discovered subdomains.  
**Action**: Regularly search for updates related to a domain.

## **Automating Hunter How**

### **Python Script for Domain Recon**
Below is a Python script for automating domain recon using Hunter How's API:  
```python
import requests

API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
DOMAIN = "example.com"

url = f"https://hunter.how/api/search?domain={DOMAIN}&api_key={API_KEY}"
response = requests.get(url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    print(f"Results for {DOMAIN}:")
    for record in data.get("records", []):
        print(record)
else:
    print(f"Error: Unable to fetch data for {DOMAIN}")
```

---

## **Practical Exercises**

### **1. Domain Reconnaissance**  
Search for a target domain (`example.com`) and analyze:  
- Subdomains.  
- DNS records.  
- Associated IPs.  

### **2. SSL/TLS Certificate Analysis**  
Find certificates issued to a domain and check for misconfigurations or expiry dates.

### **3. Threat Assessment**  
Search for open ports and services on a specific IP (`192.168.1.1`).
